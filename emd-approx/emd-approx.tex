\paragraph{Motivation} We want to perform a discretization of earth-mover distance (EMD) such that distances computed using discretized data are not too different from the distances computed using the original data.

Let's focus on 1D EMD for now, and let's assume that the original data are given in the form of continuous probability density functions over some finite interval $[\xmin, \xmax] \subset \mathbb R^1$.

Suppose we are given two probability density functions $p_1$ and $p_2$, and a set of $k$ points $Z \subset [\xmin, \xmax]$.  Let $\phi_Z(p)$ denote the discretized version of a probability density function $p$, where all the probability mass at point $x$ has been moved to the nearest value $z \in Z$.  We want to characterize the \emph{EMD discretization error}, which is the difference
\[ \Delta(p_1, p_2; Z) = \EMD(\phi_Z(p_1), \phi_Z(p_2)) - \EMD(p_1, p_2). \]

\noindent There are several questions we could ask:
\begin{itemize}
\item Given $p_1$ and $p_2$, what values of $Z$ minimize or maximize $\Delta(p_1, p_2; Z)$?
\item Given $p_1$ and $Z$, what values of $p_2$ minimize or maximize $\Delta(p_1, p_2; Z)$?
\item Given $p_1$, what values of $Z$ and $p_2$ minimize or maximize $\Delta(p_1, p_2; Z)$?
\item Given $Z$, what values of $p_1$ and $p_2$ minimize or maximize $\Delta(p_1, p_2; Z)$?
\end{itemize}

\noindent Similarly, if $p_1$ and $p_2$ are considered random variables:
\begin{itemize}
\item Given a distribution over $p_1$ and $p_2$, what values of $Z$ minimize or maximize $\mathbb E[\Delta(p_1, p_2; Z)]$?
\item Given $Z$, what distributions over $p_1$ and $p_2$ minimize or maximize $\mathbb E[\Delta(p_1, p_2; Z)]$?
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Observations} After choosing $Z$, consider the Voronoi tesselation of $\mathbb R^1$ relative to $Z$.  We can create a large negative discretization error if we place all of the probability mass at the far left end of a Voronoi cell in $p_1$ and at the far right end of the same Voronoi cell in $p_2$ (in this case, the discretized EMD becomes 0).  On the other hand, we can create a large positive discretization error as follows: if $\tilde x$ is the boundary between two Voronoi cells (i.e., $\tilde x = (z_i + z_{i+1})/2$ for some $i$), then we can place all of the probability mass at $\tilde x - \eps$ in $p_1$ and at $\tilde x + \eps$ in $p_2$.  In this case, the discretized EMD will be $\abs{z_{i+1}-z_i}$, whereas the original EMD was arbitrarily close to $0$.

Also, if $p_1 = p_2$, then $\phi_Z(p_1) = \phi_Z(p_2)$ for any $Z$, and so $\Delta(p_1, p_2; Z) = 0$.  That is, equal distributions always have equal discretizations.

\paragraph{Conjecture} If we want to reduce the dimension of our data to at most $k$ features, and we want to minimize the worst-case EMD discretization error, we should select an evenly-spaced set of points:
\[ Z = \left\{ \xmin + \frac{2j-1}{2k}(\xmax-\xmin) : j \in \{ 1, \ldots, k \} \right\}. \]

This way, the maximum width of a Voronoi cell will be $1/k$; this limits the amount by which the distance between a pair of distributions can be \emph{decreased}.  Furthermore, the maximum distance between adjacent points in $Z$ will be $1/k$; this limits the amount by which the distance between a pair of distributions can be \emph{increased}.

Can we do better if we know that the distributions over $p_1$ and $p_2$ are such that certain subsets of $\mathbb R^1$ are expected to receive very low probability density?

In particular, suppose $D$ is a ``meta-distribution'' (a distribution over distributions over $\mathbb R$), with $p_1 \sim D$ and $p_2 \sim D$.  Then, for what values of $Z$ is the distribution of the discretization error $\Delta(p_1, p_2; Z)$ ``well-behaved'' (e.g., bounded near zero, or highly concentrated near zero)?

Consider a special case where the distributions generated by $D$ are all discrete distributions.  Let $f_D$ be a density function over $\mathbb R$ with finite support, and let $F_D$ be the corresponding cumulative density function.  For some fixed $n$, suppose the distributions generated by $D$ consist of discrete distributions where $n$ points are sampled from $f_D$, and each of the points are assigned a probability mass of $1/n$.

It seems plausible that a good way to choose $Z$ is to define
\[ \alpha_j = \frac{2j-1}{2k}, \quad \text{ for } j \in \{1, \ldots, k \}, \]
and choose $Z$ by computing the inverse CDF on these points:
\[ Z = \left\{ F_D^{-1}(\alpha_j) : j \in \{ 1, \ldots, k \} \right\}. \]

If we assume $f_D$ is the uniform distribution over $[\xmin, \xmax]$, this coincides with the earlier choice of $Z$.  More generally, this method tends to avoid regions in $\mathbb R$ where $f_D$ has low density.

One minor modification might be necessary: if any of the points $z_i \in Z$ lands in a region where $f_D(x) = 0$, would it make sense to adjust them to coincide with the nearest $x$-value for which $f_D(x)$ is non-zero?  More precisely, should we apply something like the following update rule?  (Is this likely to increase or decrease the discretization error?)
\[ z_i \mapsto \arginf_{x : f_D(x) > 0} \abs{x-z_i}. \]

In practice, we will not have access to the distribution $D$ from which $p_1$ and $p_2$ are drawn.  Instead, we should find an estimate $\hat F_D$ of $F_D$ using a large sample of discrete distributions $p_i$ drawn from $D$.

How can we translate this into a practical algorithm for selecting $Z$ given $k$?

Idea: take a sample of distributions $p_1, \ldots, p_n$, with CDFs $F_1, \ldots F_n$.  Then, estimate the cumulative density using
\[ \hat F_D(x) = \frac1n \sum_i F_i(x). \]
Next, compute the inverse of the estimated cumulative density function, and let 
\[Z = \{ \hat F_D^{-1}: j \in 1, \ldots, k\},\]
where the $\alpha_j$'s are as defined above.

Here is an example of this procedure performed on a subsample of the ChemCam data:
\quickFig{0.6}{../dim_reduction/wavelengths_density_dependent.pdf}

Major caveat: there are many plausible distributions $D$ that this special case does not cover.  For instance, $D$ could select a ``base'' distribution from some set and then add noise to it.  When performing discretization, we should be careful not to lose the ability to distinguish between different base distributions.  This limitation may explain why the density-dependent reduction performs poorly in the results below.

\paragraph{Results} I've attempted three different dimensionality reductions:

\begin{outline}[enumerate]
\1 $k$-means reduction: whenever a wavelength is associated with an intensity of more than 0.02\% of the total, add it to a list of wavelengths (allowing duplicates), and perform 1-D $k$-means clustering on the result
\1 Density-dependent reduction: uses estimation of $\hat F_D$ described above
\1 Uniformly-spaced reduction: uses points spaced evenly between $\xmin$ and $\xmax$
\end{outline}

For each of these methods, I created a reduced dataset with only 50 columns instead of 6144.
I then computed a pairwise earth-mover distance matrix for a set of 500 random spectra, evaluated on the raw data (6144 wavelengths) and on each of the reduced datasets.
To measure how well distances are preserved by each reduction, I computed the Frobenius norm of the difference between pairs of matrices:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
Source of distance matrix $D_A$ & Source of distance matrix $D_B$ & $\norm{D_A-D_B}_F$ \\ \hline
Original data & $k$-means reduced data         & 22.94 \\
Original data & Density-dependent reduced data & 75.15 \\
Original data & Uniform-spacing reduced data   & 35.21
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Hence, the $k$-means approach seems to preserve pairwise EMD significantly better than the density-dependent approach.  Surprisingly, even a naive uniform dimensionality reduction performs much better than a density-dependent approach.  It would be interesting to try to understand from a theoretical perspective why this happens.

\section*{Alternative approach: Proportional assignments}

In the previous scheme, we assigned all of the probability mass at a point $x$ to the closest $z_i \in Z$.  This allowed the possibility of increasing the distance between two distributions when probability mass is moved across the boundary between Voronoi cells.  We now consider whether a different discretization scheme might avoid this possibility.

An alternative scheme is to divide the mass at $x$ between its left and right neighbors, based on the distances $x$ and these neighbors.  In particular, if a probability distribution assigns mass $1$ to a point $x$ that lies between $z_i$ and $z_{i+1}$, then the discretized version of this distribution will assign
\begin{align*}
\frac{z_{i+1}-x}{z_{i+1}-z_i} & \text{ to $z_i$, and} \\
\frac{x-z_i}{z_{i+1}-z_i}     & \text{ to $z_{i+1}$.}
\end{align*}
Note that if there is a localized mass halfway between $z_i$ and $z_{i+1}$, it will end up divided evenly between the left and right neighbors.  Small perturbations to such a distribution will no longer cause large increases in the discretized distance.

Generalizing this to an arbitrary probability density function $p : \mathbb R \to \mathbb R$, the discretized distribution $\phi_Z(p)$ assigns the following mass to $z_i$:
\begin{align*}
& \int_{z_{i-1}}^{z_i} p(x) \frac{x-z_{i-1}}{z_i-z_{i-1}} \, dx
+ \int_{z_i}^{z_{i+1}} p(x) \frac{z_{i+1}-x}{z_{i+1}-z_i} \, dx \\
&\qquad =
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} p(x) \max\left(0, \min \left(
  \frac{x-z_{i-1}}{z_i-z_{i-1}},
  \frac{z_{i+1}-x}{z_{i+1}-z_i}
\right)\right) \, dx \\
&\qquad =
E_{X \sim p}[w_i(X)],
\end{align*}
where
\[
w_i(x) = \max\left(0, \min \left(
  \frac{x-z_{i-1}}{z_i-z_{i-1}},
  \frac{z_{i+1}-x}{z_{i+1}-z_i}
\right)\right).
\]

Note that we can express the all-or-nothing nearest-neighbor assignment method in a similar form, except we must replace $w_i$ with
\begin{align*}
w_{i,\mathrm{nearest}}(x)
&=
\begin{cases}
1, & \frac{z_{i-1} + z_i}{2} < x < \frac{z_i + z_{i+1}}{2}, \\
0, & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
\end{align*}

Returning to the proportional-assignment approach, consider the case where a probability distribution $p_1$ assigns mass $1$ to some point $x_1 \in (z_i, z_{i+1})$ for some $i$, and another distribution $p_2$ assigns mass $1$ to some point $x_2$ in the same interval.

Note that the original distance is $\EMD(p_1,p_2) = \abs{x_1-x_2}$.  The discretized distance is
\begin{align*}
\EMD(\phi_Z(p_1), \phi_Z(p_2))
&=
\EMD\left(
\begin{lrcases}
z_i, & \text{w.p.\ $\frac{z_{i+1}-x_1}{z_{i+1}-z_i}$} \\
z_{i+1}, & \text{w.p.\ $\frac{x_1-z_i}{z_{i+1}-z_i}$}
\end{lrcases}
,
\begin{lrcases}
z_i, & \text{w.p.\ $\frac{z_{i+1}-x_2}{z_{i+1}-z_i}$} \\
z_{i+1}, & \text{w.p.\ $\frac{x_2-z_i}{z_{i+1}-z_i}$}
\end{lrcases}
\right) \\
&= (z_{i+1}-z_i) \abs{\frac{z_{i+1}-x_1}{z_{i+1}-z_i} - \frac{z_{i+1}-x_2}{z_{i+1}-z_i}} \\
&= \abs{x_1 - x_2} \\
&= \EMD(p_1, p_2).
\end{align*}

This shows that the earthmover distance is preserved for this simple case.

Note that there are still some cases where the discretized distance decreases to zero.  For instance, if $p_1$ and $p_2$ both have support inside the interval $(z_i, z_{i+1})$ and both are symmetrically distributed around the point $\frac{z_i + z_{i+1}}{2}$, they will both discretize to the same distribution (namely, the uniform distribution over $z_i$ and $z_{i+1}$); therefore, the discretized distance is zero, even if the original distance between $p_1$ and $p_2$ was nonzero.

Can we extend the argument above to show that the discretized distance \emph{never exceeds} the original distance?
